swell-js
========

A swell little bit of javaScript that makes sure your mobile web app looks good on all devices.

So you're making a mobile web app and you're annoyed because you can't seem to get your app to
fill the screen consistently across devices and orientations? 

Well swell-js is for you!

Just include it in your application call init() then you should be able to position/size things reliably.

Swell aims to iron out the idiosyncrasies of mobile browsers and provides a single consistent location to 
handle browser resize/orientation changes.

Really it's mainly about trying to document the differences in mobile browser behaviour and collate the 
workarounds. It's by no means complete but hopefully it's helpful.
